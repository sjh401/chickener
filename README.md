## Project Description

Chickener is a frogger style game built with React using an Airtable database of layout tiles. The user will start at the homepage with the game, but be able to navigate to a separate one for rules and game play instructions.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I am resourceful and catch on to a concept pretty quickly. I have a good idea of how I want this to operate and there's a few videos and forums I have found to help me with movement and game play.

### Weaknesses:
The rabbit hole explanation from the example shown is definitely true with me. I can get caught on an issue for a while because I usualy catch on to things quickly that I just think I can gain enough of the right knowledge to fix the issue. I end up trying a bunch of different things that half work instead of taking a step back to look at it again or asking for help.

### Opportunities:
This will be a good project to test my skills. I want a challenge, to be pushed. I think this is a doable project and I believe I can complete it with postmvp too.

### Threats:
I don't ask for help often. There were times in P1 when I could have reached out to Steve and solved my problem in a few minutes, instead I spent a bunch of time in trial and error. I learned a lot, but it was exhausting.
